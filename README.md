## About The Project
OLLI APP is a platform designed to predict electricity consumption with a high degree of accuracy, inspired by the challenges faced by growing cities like Monterrey in managing their energy resources. By leveraging advanced technologies, OLLI APP aims to provide a reliable tool for both authorities and citizens to plan and manage energy consumption effectively.

### Features
- **Interactive Maps**: Displays states or municipalities where users can input data and receive predictions about upcoming electricity consumption with 90% accuracy.
- **Detailed Consumption Data**: Provides detailed information about electricity usage, including peak times and other relevant metrics, based on the datasets used.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React, the platform is intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for users to navigate and understand the data.
- **High Precision Predictions**: Utilizes a deep learning model developed with TensorFlow and Python, trained on datasets tailored to Mexican cities, considering seasonal variations, holidays, and workdays.
- **Scalable and Adaptable**: The platform is designed to adapt to different regions and datasets, ensuring it remains relevant and useful across various contexts.

### What's Next for OLLI APP
In the future, we aim to collaborate with institutions and research centers to improve data collection and increase efficiency. Expanding the dataset will enable us to tackle more challenges and cover more remote areas, ultimately enhancing the platform's impact and utility.
